# Projection Wizard (fork by Daniel Wood/NPR)

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ This is a fork of the wonderful <a href="https://projectionwizard.org/#">Projection Wizard</a>. I have modified it slightly, and added a section at the bottom where output parameters can easily be copied for use in a forthcoming vector and raster clipping tool we are building.

More TK!

Cheers!<br>
